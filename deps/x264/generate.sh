# To get consistent builds, files generated by the original build system are
# also committed. This script executes the build system and copies those files
# to `generated/`.

# Running this script is only necessary when updating the dependency in the
# repository, and it's rather much dependant on the environment.

# Updating the dependency involves updating the submodule, running this script,
# and carefully reviewing submodule changes for things that need to be
# reflected in the project build settings.
