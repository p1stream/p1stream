## P1stream

This is early work on a utility to livestream your desktop and camera sources.
It currently targets Mac OS X 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and up.

There's [a Trello board][todo] with a rough to-do list.

### Build

You need the [Xcode] command line tools, [node.js] and [atom-shell].

To build, run `make`, then hand the entire source directory to atom-shell.

For fine-grained builds, look into [p1-build].
