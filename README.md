## P1stream

This is early work on a utility to livestream your desktop and camera sources
on a Mac. It's compatible with 10.8 (Mountain Lion) and up.

There's [a Trello board][todo] with a rough to-do list.

 [todo]: https://trello.com/b/mPsCUmiF/p1stream

### Build

The only requirement is the Xcode 5 command line tools.

Install dependencies with:

    git submodule update --init

Then use `build.sh` to build and run. For usage, see:

    ./build.sh -h
